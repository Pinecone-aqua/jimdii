# Brief

When people want to go to the fitness center, they can only find information about the fitness center and the environment on the Facebook page of the fitness center. This means that in some cases people are close to home and don't have access to other information. Just visiting. But JIMDII is a comprehensive web app that makes it easy for all fitness information and services.
